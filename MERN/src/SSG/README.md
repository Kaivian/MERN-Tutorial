# HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026 =))
# Icicle Application

A full-stack application generated by Kaivian-Template.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js (workspace: `server`)
- Frontend: Next.js + React (workspace: `client`)
- UI: Heroui
- Package manager: npm workspaces
- License: MIT © 2025 Kaivian

## Getting Started
Install dependencies and start development servers for both workspaces:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs `server` and `client` concurrently. Open the client URL it prints (usually http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts
From the project root:
- `npm run dev`        - Run server and client in parallel (development)
- `npm run build`      - Build server then client (production)
- `npm start`          - Start both in production (after build)

## File Structure
This repository is organized as a **monorepo** with two main workspaces: **client** (frontend, Next.js + Tailwind) and **server** (backend, Node.js + Express).

## Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `server` workspace and adjust values as needed.

## Notes
- `node_modules` folders are not included in the scaffold; run `npm install` before starting.
- Keep dependencies inside their respective workspaces; shared tooling can live at the root.
